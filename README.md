# Scheduling and Running Software TestCases Based on AI (Master Thesis | ABB Bryne)

## 🔄 Part 01: Azure DevOps Automated Test Run & Release Orchestration

This Python script automates **test execution** and **release deployment** across multiple agents in Azure DevOps. It dynamically assigns test cases based on agent availability and preferred assignments, then triggers separate release pipelines and test runs accordingly.

---

### 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Creates Separate Test Runs** for different agents
- ✅ **Triggers Independent Releases** with targeted stages
- ✅ **Assigns Test Cases** to agents based on availability & embedded `{Agent}` tags
- ✅ **Launches Different Pipeline Stages** based on the Test Run
- ✅ **Monitors Release & Test Run Execution** and prints detailed results

---

### 📁 Project Structure

The key stages of the script include:

1. **Fetch Test Plan, Test Suites & Test Cases**
2. **Gather Test Points and Agent Preferences**
3. **Assign Test Cases to Available Agents**
4. **Create Per-Agent Test Runs**
5. **Trigger Stage-Specific Releases**
6. **Monitor and Report Results**

---

### ⚙ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Active Azure DevOps organization
- A test plan (`RoboTestPlan`) and test suite with test cases
- Release pipeline configured with stages (e.g., `Autobot1 Stage`, `Autobot2 Stage`)
- Valid **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with appropriate permissions

---

### 🔧 Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/azure-devops-test-release-automation.git
   cd azure-devops-test-release-automation

2. **Install Required Packages**

   (Only if you add new packages in the future; current code uses requests, which is standard)
   ```bash
   pip install requests

3. **Deploy Self-Hosted Agents**

   This script uses two self-hosted agents:
      - Autobot1
      - Autobot2

   You can do the same by following the below steps :
      - Install the [Azure Pipelines Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/windows-agent?view=azure-devops&tabs=IP-V4) on your machine.
      - Register them under the same Agent Pool (POOL_ID) in Azure DevOps.
      - Ensure both agents are online and idle before running the script.
  
4. **Update the Configuration**

   In the script, set your environment variables and values:
   ```python
   AZURE_ORG = "your-org"
   PROJECT = "your-project"
   PAT = "your-personal-access-token"
   TEST_PLAN_NAME = "your-plan"
   SUITE_ID = your-suite-id
   POOL_ID = your-agent-pool-id
   RELEASE_PIPELINE_ID = your-pipeline-definition-id
   ARTIFACT_ALIAS = "_YourAlias"
   AGENT_01 = "your-preferred-agent"
   AGENT_02 = "your-preferred-agent"
   TARGET_STAGE_01 = "your-targeted-stage"
   TARGET_STAGE_02 = "your-targeted-stage"
   
---

### 🧠 How It Works

1. Test cases are tagged with agent preferences using curly braces in their names:

   ```vbnet
   Test01 {Autobot1}
   Test02 {Autobot2}
   Test03 {Autobot1,Autobot2}

2. Script fetches test points and determines which agent should run each case based on:

   - Preferred agents in the name
   - Availability from the Azure DevOps agent pool
   - Historical execution data (for now, simulated in this script)
  
3. Separate test runs are created — one per agent.
   
4. Release pipelines are triggered with different stages depending on the assigned agent.

5. Each release starts its corresponding stage.

6. The script monitors both the release status and test execution in parallel and prints out results.
